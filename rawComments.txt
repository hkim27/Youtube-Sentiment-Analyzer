Shout out to Daniel for keeping it friendly and lighthearted the whole time. I've been in interviews where the interviewer was very rigid and it in-turn made me very nervous.ENDOFCOMMENT Just want to give a shout out to Daniel, who kept the interview lighthearted and fun :) I'm sure it goes a long way in easing the interviewee's anxiety and bringing out the best in them.ENDOFCOMMENT This was actually a really good interview! Well done Brian!ENDOFCOMMENT Thanks for the awesome interview!

I was thinking, create trie out of words --> create freq map --> evaluate every word in the trie while using backtracking to undo modifications to the freq map.

The efficiency here is that you don't recreate the freq map for each word + stopping early and not repeating work when evaluating words with same prefixes like 'dog' and 'dogs' etc..

run time: O(2D + T ---> D + T)  D is number of letters in trie, T number of tiles in freq mapENDOFCOMMENT It's funny this interview. At 10:25, the interviewer is actually wrong, you don't need quotes in JS. You can just do {a: 1, b: 2}. Python is the version where you'd need quotes. I'd probably comment on that and explain that in JS if you want to name something a key using a variable you would do {[a]: 1, [b]: 2}.ENDOFCOMMENT Thank you for these sessions guys. They very very helpful.ENDOFCOMMENT Wow what an amazing interview, thank you so much for your content.ENDOFCOMMENT Lets goo Brian!!!ENDOFCOMMENT Nice job Brian!ENDOFCOMMENT Daniel was awesome. It's better to have lighthearted goofy interviewer than stone faced interviewer who says nothing, I hate those interviews.ENDOFCOMMENT I'm way too bad as a programmer but I managed to solve this with map, reduce. One of my proudest moments.ENDOFCOMMENT Great interview and video!

I felt like mentioning the optimization for the game of scrabble (wordbook wont change, can be fully processed) is kind of out of the scope of the problem at hand.ENDOFCOMMENT Hey Don, 

Would you be willing to do interviews with some people are aspiring developers? I think it would be beneficial to interview those who are working to becoming a developer.

LOVE THE VIDEOS!ENDOFCOMMENT Feel like the first answer was over engineered/hard to read. Here is what I came up with:

const scoreWord = (word, tiles) => {
  let result = 0

  for (const char of word) {
    if (tiles.includes(char)) {
      result += alphabet[char]
      tiles = tiles.replace(char, '')
    } else if (tiles.includes('_')) {
      tiles = tiles.replace('_', '')
    } else {
      return 0
    }
  }

  return result
}

and for second question:



const scoreWords = (words, tiles) => {
  let score = 0
  let bestWord = ''
  for (const word of words) {
    let tempTiles = tiles
    let tempScore = 0
    if (word.length > tiles.length) {
      return
    }

    for (const char of word) {
      if (tempTiles.includes(char)) {
        tempScore += alphabet[char]
        tempTiles = tempTiles.replace(char, '')
      } else if (tempTiles.includes('_')) {
        tempTiles = tempTiles.replace('_', '')
      } else {
        continue
      }
      if (tempScore > score) {
        score = tempScore
        bestWord = word
      }

    }
  }
  return [score, bestWord.length > 0 ? bestWord : null]
}

console.log(scoreWords(['cat', 'dog', 'foo'], 'cado_f')) //[5, "foo"]ENDOFCOMMENT Very good interview ingles!
Is helping the interview...ENDOFCOMMENT Here's my solution to the second problem:
def max_score(list_str, tiles):
  max = 0
  word = ""
  for str in list_str:
    total = scorer(str, tiles)
    if total > max:
      max = total
      word = str
  return [max, word]

print(max_score(["cat", "dog", "dogs", ], "tmac"))ENDOFCOMMENT It's impossible to read the question. Can someone please post it here?ENDOFCOMMENT The only thing that bothered me was that he was correct about copying the letters, all object keys are inherently strings and those keys were all valid var names in JavaScript. No quotes needed.

Really cool interviewer, though. A+ENDOFCOMMENT And leetcode reference of the second problem?ENDOFCOMMENT Isn't the time complexity of Q2 the same as checking the score for every word? He's just pruning the search but not improving the time complexity.ENDOFCOMMENT Zooming in would have been niceENDOFCOMMENT Nice jobENDOFCOMMENT Well i would like to try (:ENDOFCOMMENT Great practice interview and great job to Brian! Was a interesting problem, as I also never played Scrabble. Was also fun to try it myself and ended up getting a different solution.

Thanks for sharing!

Several months ago my wife wrecked her bike in which she dislocated her shoulder went to the ER and had it put back into place and was told to follow up with orthopedics.  She had a total left shoulder rotator cuff repair.  We were told it will heal 10 % a month.  So you were pretty lucky.  Good luck.ENDOFCOMMENT There‚Äôs something for everyone. Thanks for sharing that skiing isn‚Äôt your something, and that falling or failing is a part of trying.ENDOFCOMMENT I like boring and safe too.ENDOFCOMMENT Bren, you are a good man and a good father. You are an honest hard worker. You deserve to give yourself some time to rest and relax. Don‚Äôt feel guilty if you don‚Äôt work a few days. Think of it as one of the up sides to working as a gig worker. I work a 9-5 office job and I‚Äôm constantly afraid of hurting myself to the point where I couldn‚Äôt work anymore. I‚Äôm glad you have some success on YouTube as well. That‚Äôs something you‚Äôll be able to make money from for the rest of your life no matter where you are or what condition your in  again I hope you keep working at your own pace, and rest if you need to, I think you deserve it.

PS - you should probably start getting into the habit of linking your clothing store and Instagram into the description of your videos. Maybe even consider starting a Patreon or ‚Äúbuy me a coffee‚Äù website you can also link into the description of your YouTube videos.ENDOFCOMMENT Oh, Bren! So sorry to hear you hurt your shoulder! Glad you're taking it easy for a few days! I broke my foot last May and couldn't walk on it for 3 months! It was horrible to go through, but I'm doing better now!

You make me laugh a lot , great sense of humor young manENDOFCOMMENT I tripped over a short fence in the back yard last summer and broke my arm ON GRASS!

Happy your family doing wellENDOFCOMMENT I am so with you on this topic I can't tell you how many times I've gone up to various ski lodges and although I have skied most of the time I stay in the lodge and enjoy watching the other people go down. Don't really enjoy things that have an opportunity for me to risk my life or at least get hurt in the process.ENDOFCOMMENT Glad you are doing well! Prayers for continued healing !Glad that Emma n your son had a good time too!ENDOFCOMMENT Hey Bren, I'm glad it wasn't too bad of an injury! Heal up well. The icing really helps! ENDOFCOMMENT Glad you are on the mend.  You are right, this def could have been worse. Get better soon! I like safe and boring too. I am terrible on anything like skis or skates.

Sometimes we need to follow that instinct. I hope you mend well. Take care Bren.ENDOFCOMMENT So happy for you and your "new" life with an apartment and a girlfriend. Wonderful! 
I am on your side with skiing. I hit every tree on a slope...1st and last ski attempt.  Congrats to you on all of your accomplishments. 
Side note since I saw a bad comment and if possible, suggest you block the idiot commenters and not give your precious time to reply. ENDOFCOMMENT Sorry u got hurt.
Sending  From Rarotonga 
(Its in the South Pacific, part of the Cook Islands, hot here the days usually it starts around 24¬∞C here) Snow sounds awesome to me.

I have never gone skiing, or touched snow. Looks good on t.v. I'd really like2 play with the stuff.
My balance pff, nope. 
U not boring, smart guy. 
Take it easy, rest often, keep active u be good now.ENDOFCOMMENT Sending a good recovery from Utah.  I wish we would have gotten more snow here ENDOFCOMMENT Yes dude I‚Äôm with you‚Ä¶ boring and safe is my jam‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm staying away from pickle ball for this very reason‚Ä¶. I that you  will take your son there and be smart about it. Great learning experience and better this than anything else ENDOFCOMMENT enjoying your video replay I remember I first started skiing when I was 15 I was on the beginner hill not the mogel hill skiing around mogels but I as I look back I was sitting on skies not standing hardly it was quite a time for me.ENDOFCOMMENT SO glad you're ok. Seriously. 

I had a dislocated elbow in 2016 which had to be set, so I understand the kind of pain involved. I was hopped up on all kinds of painkillers for 6 hours while waiting. 

Good times.

Sounds like you know yourself pretty well so I imagine you'll not be doing anything quite so dangerous in the future. 

Again - glad you are okENDOFCOMMENT Nice video
Getting used to seeing you in a apartment instead of a car....anyway enjoy your videos so much thk uENDOFCOMMENT So glad it wasn‚Äôt worse Bren‚Ä¶ hope you feel better soon!!!!ENDOFCOMMENT Oh no! So sorry to hear that you got hurt.  Good to hear that it wasn‚Äôt worse and that you can take a couple of days to recover in the comfort of your apartment. Take care Ô∏èENDOFCOMMENT Sorry you got hurt skiing. I hope you heal quickly. I love your videos ENDOFCOMMENT Funny timing on this.  I just went skiing for the second time.  Here's my story  

I tried snowboarding first when I was 15, took a lesson and immediately fell back, got whiplash, a concussion, broke my tailbone, and totally fucked up my back.  (Someone just told me they make protective butt pads for snowboarders so buy one for your girlfriend, I wish I had wore one when I went!)

I'm big on trying to get out of my comfort zone so my friend finally got me to try skiing a few years ago.  It was the day after an ice storm and the trails were all pure ice, so I fell about 50 times that day and swore I'd never go again.

I got a job at a ski resort for the winter and after being there 4 months, I finally took a lesson.  There were 5 year olds flying past me everywhere.  I had a panic attack.  Full blown panic attack.  I couldn't breathe, couldn't stop crying, my chest hurt, and I was nauseous.  I finally calmed down and after the lesson I skiied by myself.  It was only then I could finally relax and enjoy it A LITTLE BIT.  I just start thinking of it as a full body workout instead of telling myself I was supposed to be enjoying it.  Only then did I finally enjoy it.  The natural exercise endorphins kicked in.  Which, like you said, I could just as easily hike or run.  Or snowshoe!  Have you ever given that a try? I think you would like that much more. Also, the ski boots are so uncomfortable!!! I wish they could invent more comfortable boots!!

Happy healing to you, my friend.  From one boring human to another Ô∏è I think we're even more special for being content with the simple things.ENDOFCOMMENT Welcome to old age my friend. I'm almost 46 and dislocated my shoulder a few years ago. My shoulder hasn't been the same since. I hope you heal up quickly.ENDOFCOMMENT Nothing wrong with trying something for the first time. There‚Äôs a first time for everything. However, don‚Äôt be stupid. Bee safe.  Learn something correctly the first time for the sake of safety.ENDOFCOMMENT I hope you feel better soon Bren Ô∏è
I destroyed my knee skiing, years ago after I got ran over by some teenagers Ô∏è
Knee went one way and ski got stuck the other wayENDOFCOMMENT Praise God on your sobriety  I'm clean and sober 8 years. Long hard roadENDOFCOMMENT 2018 I was riding my bike home from work and there was unmarked construction and a grade difference in the bike lane. My front tire clipped it and I went over the front handlebars, I dislocated it but with a difference  -  most normal dislocations fall out in front, my ball hit the back of my shoulder blade, dented the bone, and then came out from the back. I was not in pain bit rather shock. A few years later it came out again because I learned that in certain positions the probability of it coming out was higher. That time I felt the full force of the pain. 
I would suggest getting some exercise bands and doing some shoulder exercises a few times a week to keep it strong going forward - do that beyond the gym. It will help as you get older.ENDOFCOMMENT "We have these tournaments every night!" 
Sooo funny that story!ENDOFCOMMENT Amend.   



Glad you are ok, Daddio!ENDOFCOMMENT Oof. So sorry it went like that! 

Your son is right though, unless you're a toddler, starting out on skis is easier than a board. I would recommend not using poles until you get the hang of it. You're more likely to fall when you're first learning and there is this weird instinct to use them as you fall that can exacerbate whatever injury you're about to have. 

If you can swing it, I'd invest in just one day of beginner lessons next time, unless you have a friend who is an experienced skier AND good at teaching. 

You've got to learn how to come down the mountain making S's - all the way to the right, all the way to the left. You have to apply pressure to one leg, then the other, to do that. 

The two other basic things are "french fries" (skis parallel to eachother) edited for clarity: this is get moving more quickly down the mountain, and "pizza" (skis made into a triangle, not overlapping eachother) to slow down. In fact, you might be able to YouTube some instructions on this stuff. 

I hope you get to go again and have a good time!ENDOFCOMMENT I‚Äôm sorry you were injured, but your account of the day is so amusing. I have definitely had that experience.ENDOFCOMMENT My sister and I went skiing with the kids. I decided it was not for me and just watched.  I told my sister,  no lessons,  that there was a learners hill. She went down it with no control, luckily didn't fall.  The kids, no problem.ENDOFCOMMENT Love your gear it looks great xxENDOFCOMMENT Ouch, sorry it didn't go well. I broke my leg, the first and only (!) time I tried to ski.
